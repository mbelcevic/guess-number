# Guess the Number Game

## Description
This is a simple command-line "Guess the Number" game. The player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The game offers three difficulty levels: easy, medium, and hard, which determine the number of attempts the player has.

## How to Play
1. **Choose Difficulty**: When prompted, enter `easy`, `medium`, or `hard` to set the difficulty level.
   - **Easy**: 10 attempts
   - **Medium**: 7 attempts
   - **Hard**: 5 attempts

2. **Guess the Number**: Enter a number between 1 and 100 when prompted. The game will tell you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct, and how many attempts you have left.

3. **Win or Lose**: If you guess the number correctly within the allowed attempts, you win! Otherwise, you lose, and the correct number is revealed.

4. **Play Again**: After each game, you will be asked if you want to play again. Enter `yes` to play again or `no` to exit.
